### Define
Air quality is an issue, especially in urban areas. Monitor and warn people of AQI in their area

### Discover
Look into types of polution, but guide towards particulate matter.
Look into devices that can measure these values

### Design
Guided design of sensor housing. Sensor needs airflow, but Pi needs to be protected from rain.

### Decompose
- Connect sensor
- Test sensor
- Connect to a cloud platform
- Test upload to platform
- Create full script
- Automate runs
- Add to housing

### Develop
Basic instructions for each of the above, with some guidance and opportunities for independence

### Demonstrate
Publishing the available data for local use.
