Now that your air quality monitoring station can measure atmospheric tempersature and humidity, it is time to start looking at polutants in the air.

Particulate matter are microscopic particles of solids or liquids that are suspended in the air. You'll probably be most familiar with smoke as a form of particulate matter, produced when fuels are burned.

Particluate matter is extremely small and is often categorised into different sizes.

Examples of particles less than 10µm in diameter exist in the air are dust and pollen.

Examples of particles less than 2.5µm are in the air are smoke and viruses.

The SDS011 is a sensor that can detect particulate matter in the air. In this project you will use the sensor to record values for the particulate matter in your local area and upload the data to an Internet Of Things service, so that others can view and use your data.
